## Introduction  

There is a good amount of discussion on what constitutes a good coding style and
what practices should it enforce.
First of all, every coding style should obviously vary according to the needs of the
language and should adapt to the working environment used by programmers, since the tools
that are used may have a direct influence on why certain practices should be recommended
(a good example being the archaic, older than God discussion on whether one should use
tabs or spaces - which is still a very valid discussion).
They should, in general, allow for a certain degree of flexibility, leaving programmers
and their common sense to decide whether a rule should be followed or bended, by being
specific and trying to approach (possibly with detailed examples) as many cases as
possible.

As a lone programmer one can sometimes forget the importance of writing well structured, 
easy-to-maintain code. When working in teams, be it small or large ones, or developing
open source software, coding standards can determine the successfulness of a project.

This repository's main goal is not to define yet another coding standard, but merely to
allow programmers to analyze with as much evenhandedness as possible, what should be
considered good styles and practices, by presenting the rationales that sustain them.
It mostly tries to summarize the pros and cons of rules that have been widely debated and
be a compilation of discussions and standards where valid points were made.

This is as much of a learning experience as a source of wisdom.

We hope it might be as useful to you as it is to us.

## Structure

At this moment we're are using the following structure:

* coding-standards
 * [Languages.md] (https://github.com/CarameloMartins/Daemon/blob/master/Languages.md) - Coding standards for
   several languages, alphabetically ordered.
 * [Projects.md] (https://github.com/CarameloMartins/Daemon/blob/master/Projects.md) - Coding standards for
   several projects, alphabetically ordered.
 * [Sources.md] (https://github.com/CarameloMartins/Daemon/blob/master/Sources.md) - Sources where we found 
   several coding standards.

## TODO

- Tutorial - I think a tutorial section would be a good idea. Both for languages and specific projects/subjects.
- Debate - A section with resources that could help people better understand certain topics that are less plain.
- Tools - A section with tools to help in the developing process.
